# EasyDX
Make DirectX easy to use.

# TODO

* ~~Per-monitor DPI aware~~
* ~~Direct2D 1.1 & DirectWrite~~
* Models ~~(overhaul required)~~
* ~~Events~~
* Constant Buffer
* Cameras (movement)
* Textures (2D textures is complete)
* Lighting (More tests required)
* Remove `Scene::{Start, Destroy, Update}`. Replace {`Start`, `Destroy`} with constructor and destructor, `Update` with callbacks(`std::vector<std::function>>`).
